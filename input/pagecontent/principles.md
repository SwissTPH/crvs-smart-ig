# Principles and data standards

## Principles for Digitalization
These principles ensure digital CRVS systems align with United Nations standards (UNSD, 2014) and address inclusivity, security, and sustainability, as emphasized in Workshop Group 1 feedback.

- **Compulsory**
  - **Legal Compliance**: Systems must adhere to national laws (e.g., civil registration, ICT, privacy, data protection) and international frameworks (e.g., UN treaties), ensuring digitally issued documents are legally recognized.
  - **Free Access**: Registration and the first certificate must be free, with fees limited to additional services like duplicate certificates.
  - **Data Quality Assurance**: Embed tools to monitor timeliness (current, late, delayed), accuracy, and completeness, supporting reliable vital statistics.

- **Universality**
  - **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Design systems to serve all populations, including rural and vulnerable groups, with mobile and multi-language support (Workshop Group 1).
  - **Equitable Digital Access**: Ensure fairness across geographic and socioeconomic divides, preventing a digital divide.
  - **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user needs to avoid marginalization, incorporating intuitive interfaces and accessible channels.

- **Continuous and Permanent**
  - **Legal Recognition**: (Digital) Certificates must hold legal validity under national and international law.
  - **Resilience and Continuity**: Build systems to withstand disruptions (natural or human-induced) with robust disaster recovery plans.
  - **Sustainability and Scalability**: Ensure long-term viability through cost-effective scaling and sustainable technical, financial, and administrative plans.
  - **Country Ownership and Data Sovereignty**: Governments must control systems and data, using open standards to avoid vendor lock-in.
  - **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Enable systems to evolve with technological and national changes.

- **Confidentiality and Security**
  - **Data Protection and Privacy**: Implement encryption and comply with laws like GDPR or national equivalents, safeguarding personal data (Workshop Group 1).
  - **Promote Data Use and Interoperability**: Facilitate secure data sharing across sectors (e.g., health, ID systems) using open standards (Workshop Group 1).
  - **Alignment with National Context**: Leverage existing infrastructure and skillsets, adopting gradual scale-up strategies.

## Standards
Standards ensure consistency, security, and interoperability, harmonization and best practices.

- **Legal Framework and Governance**
  - Align with national ICT and data protection laws, defining minimum hardware specifications for reliability.
- **Data Standards**
  - Use UNSD-recommended data fields for vital events (birth, death, etc.), ensuring comprehensive capture (UNSD, 2014).
- **Security and Privacy**
  - Adhere to ISO 27001 for cybersecurity, with regular audits and backup policies (Workshop Group 1).
- **Interoperability**
  - Employ open standards (e.g., OData, XML) for data exchange with systems like national ID or health databases (Workshop Group 2).
- **International Standards**
  - Comply with global frameworks for consistency and cross-border data sharing.

## Best Practices and Recommendations.

- **Harmonization**: Align systems across regions using shared standards and APIs (e.g., Benin’s interoperability model).
- **Evaluation**: Regularly assess performance and efficiency, adopting best practices from member countries.
- **Case Studies**: Highlight successes like Rwanda’s pre-reform birth registration (UNICEF, 2017).
