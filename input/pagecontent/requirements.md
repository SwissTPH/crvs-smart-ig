## Functional Requirements
These outline what the system must do, drawn from the TWC report and enriched with practical details.

- **Registration Services**
  - **Notification**: Capture event reports from authorized sources (e.g., health centers) with configurable validation rules.
  - **Declaration**: Enable informants (e.g., parents, health staff) to submit official requests, verified by signature or digital means.
  - **Registration**: Formal enrollment by registrars, including generating unique IDs by the civil registrar, the ID agency, the population register, or any other actor in the local ID ecosystem and ensuring quality checks.
  - **Certification**: Issue verifiable certificates (digital or physical) with cryptographic signatures.
  - **Unique ID Generation**: Assign randomized, unique identifiers at birth, compliant with legal frameworks and retire the ID upon death registration.

- **Data Management**
  - Support additions, amendments, and corrections, maintaining auditable records of changes.

- **Reporting and Analysis**
  - Provide standard reports (e.g., UNSD tables) and customizable dashboards, disaggregated by region and event type.

- **User Role and Access Control**
  - Implement role-based access (e.g., registrar, clerk) with audit trails and identity management.

- **Interoperability**
  - Link to national ID, health, and statistics systems using harmonized data standards (Workshop Group 2).

- **Security and Privacy**
  - Use encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA), and zero-trust security models.

- **Multi-language Support**
  - Offer interfaces and data storage in multiple languages, per country needs (Workshop Group 1).

- **Mobile and Web Accessibility**
  - Ensure offline functionality and mobile-friendly design for field operations.

## Non-Functional Requirements
These ensure system performance and usability, based on TWC recommendations.

- **Performance**: Respond within milliseconds for standard operations, with optimized database performance.
- **Scalability**: Handle growing users and data volumes cost-effectively.
- **Availability and Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime with automated backups and defined recovery objectives (RTO, RPO).
- **Security**: Comply with data protection laws, using 2FA and VPNs for secure access.
- **Usability**: Provide training, intuitive design, and real-time validation to reduce errors.
- **Maintainability**: Use modular architecture and detailed documentation for seamless updates.
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to national and international privacy laws.
- **Accessibility**: Meet digital accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) for all users.
