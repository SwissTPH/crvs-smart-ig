# Digital Principle and Data Standard for CRVS Systems

THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF L3 containing L2 information 

THIS IS NOT FHIR, it only use the same tooling which are efficient

It was drafted following a workshop organized in Kigali in February 2025 and looking at the DCI standard.


## Context 

The African e-CRVS Shared Asset (ACSA) initiative aims at putting in place guidance for integrated and harmonized digital Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (e-CRVS) system that will accelerate civil registration in Africa.
The ACSA initiative is led by a Board of African countries with the support three development partners namely UNICEF, UNECA and Vital Strategies.


Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems record vital events—births, deaths, marriages, and other legally recognized events—providing individuals with legal identity and governments with essential data for planning and policy-making. Digitalization enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of these systems, aligning them with modern governance needs. These *Design Principles and Data Standards* offers a comprehensive, standardized framework for designing and implementing digital CRVS systems, balancing international best practices with national contexts.

**Purpose**: To guide stakeholders in creating inclusive, secure, and sustainable digital CRVS solutions that meet the core principles of civil registration—compulsoriness, universality, continuity and permanence, and confidentiality—while addressing functional and operational requirements.

## CRVS Events

The current focus is on 
- **Live Birth**: Complete expulsion of a live infant, registered regardless of survival (WHO, 2010).
- **Marriage**: Legal union recognized by national laws, including registered partnerships where applicable.

Later on other CRVS event could be worked on
- **Death**: Permanent cessation of life post-birth, excluding foetal deaths (WHO, 2010).
- **Foetal Death**: Death before expulsion, distinguished from live births (WHO, 2010).
- **Ruling**: Includes:
  - **Divorce**: Legal dissolution of marriage.
  - **Annulment**: Voiding of marriage.
  - **Separation**: Disunion without remarriage rights.
  - **Adoption**: Legal recognition of a child as one’s own.
  - **Legitimation**: Granting wedlock status.
  - **Recognition**: Acknowledgment of paternity.
